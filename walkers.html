    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Walkers(commonly confused with Zombies, but they're different I promise) are the remnants of humans that have died and been reanimated. They possess no memories of their past life and show 
        very little intelligence, if any at all. They also have a insatiable hunger for human flesh, and will relentlessly
        pursue any prey they come across. While they can only perform some basic motor, Walkers have a heighened sense
        of smell and hearing to help them detect prey. In addition to this, despite their decomposing body, Walkers can be surprisingly strong,
        as they've been seen tearing away limbs and ripping through skin with only their hands.

        No one knows exactly where the Walkers originally came from. Some say they are the result of a airborne virus that causes 
        reanimation after death, others believe they came from a comic book.

        Walkers are able to spread their virus to other living humans. If a human is bitten by a Walker, they will eventually die and become
        a Walker themselves. Because of this, groups of Walkers are able to quickly grow in numbers. When in large enough groups, Walkers have been known to cause apocalypse-level catastrophes that completely shut down whole countries, and even
        continents. Visitors do not need to worry though, as we only have six of them.
