    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Creepers are one of the many mobs(monsters/enemies) in Minecaft, one of the most popular games in the world today. Their 
        design is actually based on a mistake made by the game's creator, Notch. While building the game, Notch accidentally created a pig 
        with along torso and extra legs, and instead of deleting it, he instead gave it a green-grey color pattern, a unsettling face, and
        lots of explosives. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Although some believe the Creepers are made of some sort of fungus. But hey, that's just a <i>theory.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        Like the other mobs in Minecaft, Creepers can be found at night or around any dark area. However, unlike other mobs, Creepers
        are completely silent as the sneak up on their prey. Once close enough, it makes a small hissing noise before exploding, taking
        anything and anyone to close to the blast with it. To ensoure the safety of our visitors, the Creeper enclosure is surrounded by 
        a two-way mirror to prevent them from getting too hostile.
