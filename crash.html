    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Crash Bandicoot start his life as a simple  eastern barred bandicoot on N. Sanity Island, until he was captured by Dr. Neo Cortex. His
        experiments on the creature resulted in his evolution, allowing him to stand and walk on two legs, run and jump at superhuman levels, 
        and gain (relative) intelligence. Upon realizing his creator was evil, he and his sister, Coco(who was also evolved through experimentation),
        escaped Cortex's lab and decided to fight back. Since that day. Crash, Coco, their adopted brother Crunch(who was also evolved by Cortex after
        Crash and Coco escaped), and their magical protector Aku Aku, have been in a constant battle with Cortex.

        Crash is a very high energy creature. He loves to run, jump, break boxes for fun. Because he's been constantly fighting Cortex for the
        last 25 years, he loves to stay active. At his enclosure, visitors can set up osbtacle courses for him to complete, and watch as he enjoys
        reward for completing them: his beloved Wumpa Fruit.
