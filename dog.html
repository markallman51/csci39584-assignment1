    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Many games have their common enemies that the player can find in many areas and fight for extra point/xp. Mario has Goombas, Minecraft
        has Zombies, and Borderlands has Skags. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Skags are wild wolf-like creatures native to the planet Pandora. They tend to live in underground burrows, with most of the pack 
        underground while few roam the surrounding area for food. Skags are known for being extremely agressive, and usually attack anything
        that moves. With their razor-sharp claws on their hands and around their mouth, strong armor plates around their body, and vicious battle
        cry, Skags always strike fear in their prey.

        Some Skags also have some special abilites. Spitter Skags are able to projective spit balls of acid to attack their prey from a distance.
        Elder Skags are able to do the same with their sharp tongues, which are able to grow twice as long as the Skag itself. The most dangerous
        Skags are able to harness certain elements(fire, electricity) and use them against their prey.

        As vicious as Skags can be, there are very rare occasions where Skags can be tamed and kept as pets or guard animals. Luckily, we where
        able to find a couple friendly Skags for our zoo.
